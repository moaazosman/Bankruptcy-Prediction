**Bankruptcy Prediction**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Bankcrupt.ipynb) that demonstrates the process of building a bankruptcy prediction model using machine learning. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt based on its financial and accounting data.

**Data**

The dataset used for this project includes financial and accounting information of various companies, with a binary target variable indicating whether the company went bankrupt or not. The data is preprocessed and cleaned to prepare it for modeling.

**Notebook Contents**

The Jupyter Notebook is divided into several sections, each representing a step in the machine learning pipeline:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: In this section, the dataset is loaded into the notebook, and initial exploration is performed to understand the structure and features of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: This section involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.

3. Feature Selection: Feature selection techniques are applied to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the bankruptcy prediction.

4. Model Building: Several machine learning models are implemented, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to build the bankruptcy prediction model.

5. Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


**Dependencies**

To run the notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Usage**

To use this repository, simply download the Bankcrupt.ipynb notebook and the dataset file. Then, open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells in order to replicate the bankruptcy prediction model building process.
